        Johan combined his education with his passion for skating and founded
        Maple Skate in 1990.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johan started producing both longtrack and shorttrack skates, as well as
        inline skates, working from a small home-office. Later he moved into a
        small factory/workspace in Diever (The Netherlands) which remains to
        this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Johan's wings Maple Skate became a well known brand in the skating
        world, with many Olympic and World Champions skating on his 'golden
        blades'. During these years Maple was the official equipment supplier of
        Speedskating Canada and the Korea Skating Union.

      <p>Johan Bennink sold Maple Skate to a third party in 2005.</p>
