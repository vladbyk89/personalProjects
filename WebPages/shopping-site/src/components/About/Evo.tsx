        Retirement did not last long. In 2009 Johan Bennink founded EvoSkate -
        commonly known as Evo - in collaboration with Canadian speedskater
        Derrick Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johan designed the blades, and EvoSkate outsourced the production of
        aluminum parts to a third party in the Netherlands. During these years
        Evo grew to be a great success.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of 2019, Derrick Campbell and Johan Bennink stopped their
        cooperation after an internal dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Johan Bennink continues to develop and manufacture Evo skates in his own
        territories.
